Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Currently we use an api key of iam user with fullaccess to s3 to upload object to s3. 
If the api key is stolen, the hacker can use it to do bad things on our s3 buckets

# Poor practice 2
The RecipeWebServiceInstance is having a role with full access to all of the s3 and also it facing the internet as well, which would lead to a bad situation if the hacker get access to the ec2
